/**
 * The extended model implementation for the Route service.
 * Represents a row in the &quot;GL_Route&quot; database table, with each column mapped to a property of this class.
 * Never reference this class directly.
 * All methods that expect a route model instance should use the {@link es.eina.tfg.model.Route} interface instead.
 *
 * <p>
 * Helper methods and all application logic should be put in this class.
 * Whenever methods are added, rerun ServiceBuilder to copy their definitions into the {@link es.eina.tfg.model.Route} interface.
